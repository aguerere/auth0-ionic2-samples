# Auth0 + Ionic2 + API Sample

This is a sample Ionic project that uses Auth0 for Authentication. 
It's the basic tabs example from [Ionic 2](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/) with the added authentication from [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).

## Running the example

In order to run the project, you need to have `node`, `ionic 2`, `cordova` and `ios-sim` installed.
Once you have that, just clone the project and run the following:

1. `npm install`
2. `ionic platform add ios`
3. `ionic build ios`
4. `ionic emulate ios`

Enjoy your Ionic app now :).
